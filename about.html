                            Hi! My name is Jazmine Bohanon. I am so glad you decided to visit my blog. I hope you find yoruself
                            in my content. I am a mother of 5 beautiful children and a fur baby. I live in Cleveland, OH and it is my 
                            hometown as well. I decided to get into coding because it was something I was always interested in I just
                            though it was too late for me. Usually these jobs want you to have a 4 year degree and I did not have that. 
                            That is why I am thankful for programs like the ones here at Udacity that allows us to get the expeience and
                            get a career without the 4 year degree. So here I am, stepping out on faith and going full steam ahead with 
                            all the faith that in the end I will be successful and be able to provide the life I have always wanted for
                            my kids. 
                        </p>

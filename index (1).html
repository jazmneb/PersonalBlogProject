                                This wasn't so bad to learn. I had a little expeience
                                with HTML before I got into Udacity
                                so this felt like a refresher and
                                not too intimidating.
                                So I breezed through it...<a href="post1.html">Read More</a>

                                I have a real hard time trying not to feel like I need to be
                                an expert at everything that I try. It's almost like if I'm not
                                an expert then I have no right to even try the skill 
                                professionally. I can't do that with this nanodegree, I have

                                Yayyy!! I made it to CSS! Design is my favorite part of this. It's
                                something that feels familiar to me because I've done a lot of Design
                                work in my past and present. I've designed websites and digital flyers
                                so this is going to be fun! <a href="post2.html">Read More</a>

                                We had a career project to do. We had to research Front End Web Development positions
                                and it was a little intimidating. Am I going to be able to find a profession in this 
                                once I complete this nanodegree? Faith is the key...<a href="post3.html">Read More</a>

                                OMG! This course is getting tougher. I had no problem absorbing the information in this
                                course until this. CSS Grid is hard to digest, but I feel like once I get more hands on
                                with it I will understand it better...<a href="post4.html">Read More</a>

                                Now we put it all together in a blog project. I'm excited and itimidated all at the same time.
                                This our 2nd coding project but the first one felt like a breeze, this is a whole website.

                            <p>
                                Now we put it all together in a blog project. I'm excited and itimidated all at the same time.
                                This is our 2nd coding project but the first one felt like a breeze, this is a whole website. 
                                Challenge accepted.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So I have ADHD and anxiety which is where the challenge for this project truly lies. I have to 
                                be able to plan this project in a way where it seems more manageable for me. At the same time,
                                though, I need to just start because my anxiety might get overwhelmed from mapping out the entire
                                thing, and being able to see how many potential obstacles that I will have to overcome, and then 
                                decide we have to put it off (SMH) . So the plan is to start and plan as I go to trick my anxiety 
                                and overcome my ADHD symptoms. I won't get overwhelmed (well I will just not as bad) if I plan as
                                I go because I will only plan whatever section I'm currently focused on.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I am very proud of myself for making it this far and attacking these challenges head on. this
                                is something I have always wanted to do, but was too afraid to try it out for myself. I swear
                                perception is everything. I really thought only a specific person could do computer science, and 
                                I never thought it would be an African American single mother of 5 children could fit the bill, but 
                                I'm glad it's me, maybe I will inspire other moms like me and let them know it's never too late to 
                                pursue your dreams. Anyways, wish me luck!
